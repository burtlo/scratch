# Scratch

This project is a bare-bones project that is a good way
to use **guard-shell** to watch changes on ruby files and
runs them.

This is useful when exploring concepts in ruby when the
code is much more complicated than a single irb session.

## Getting Started

```
$ bundle
$ guard
```

Create a ruby file (*.rb). Save and watch the output appear
in the Guard logs.
