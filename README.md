# Scratch

This project is a bare-bones project that lets you write
and play with Ruby quickly and easily.

1. bundle install
2. touch playingaround.rb
3. $EDITOR playingaround.rb
4. guard

Guard will watch for any ruby files that are in the directory
and automatically run them. Allowing you to have a similar 
experience to IRB but with your editor. This is useful when 
exploring concepts in ruby when the code is much more 
complicated than a single irb session.

## Getting Started

```
$ bundle
$ guard
```

Create a ruby file (*.rb). Save and watch the output appear
in the Guard logs.
